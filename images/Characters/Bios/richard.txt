Richard Farr
Age: 29

The head of his household, Richard only wants what's best for his wife and two young daughters. While normally calm and methodical in his reasoning, all of that can be thrown out the window if his family is in harm's way.

He tolerates and accepts the fact that REDD are a part of society, but he, like many others, believes that the REDD War should be stopped, a future he believes is possible, despite his wife, Laura, believing otherwise.

He doesn't believe he loves one of his daughters more than the other, but he unknowingly gives his older daughter, Dakota, less attention than her sister, Kate.
