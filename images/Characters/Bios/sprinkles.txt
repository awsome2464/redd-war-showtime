Mr. Sprinkles/Krag Dovason
Age: 56

Krag Dovason is a REDD who hosts an acclaimed children's show, "Mr. Sprinkles", where he plays the title character, an energetic, overly-excited clown-like character who loves fun and games.

Off screen, Dovason is more calm and collected and practices what he preaches: the cooperation of humanity and REDD-kind. Some humans even refer to him as a "Modern-Day Mister Rogers", with his calm mannerisms and strong beliefs making him the biggest face of the anti-War movement.

But when drama with a cast member killing children during a REDD War leads to protests from angry parents, which leads to his show on the verge of being cancelled, Dovason feels betrayed by his fans, which causes him to snap and decide to show those no-good parents just how bad a REDD can really be. With that, he turns his Mr. Sprinkles persona from a fun-loving clown a la Ronald McDonald into a crazy, unpredictable psychopath a la The Joker.
