Dakota Farr
Age: 9

She can be a bit cold at times, but she's still a child who loves shows like Mr. Sprinkles, even if she would never admit it out loud.

She is getting to the age where she understands what the REDD War is and how it can affect the lives of so many innocent people. She tends to keep her feelings about this subject bottled up, but can open them up fairly easily to the right person, namely her mother, Laura.

She claims to simply put up with her younger sister Kate, but it's clear that, despite her trash talk, she loves her and only wants what's best for her.

She often feels like her father cares more about Kate than her, and is constantly trying to prove that she can be just as capable of being loved by him.
