Kate Farr
Age: 6

Kate is about as naive and oblivious to the world as anyone else her age. Her favorite show is Mr. Sprinkles, and she's excited to go to the the live show being held in her town of Atlanta.

She doesn't view REDD like Sprinkles as any different than humans, very unaware that most REDD are violent killing machines. It's unclear if she even knows that Mr. Sprinkles is a completely different species than a human.

She loves everyone in her family very much, but her father, Richard, seems to be the biggest recipient of her love. She often finds her sister, Dakota, a bit mean at times, and she often asks her mother, Laura, why she's always so tired.
